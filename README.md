# opencode-with-claude

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Use [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) with your [Claude Max](https://claude.ai) subscription.

## What this is

An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that runs [opencode-claude-max-proxy](https://github.com/rynfar/opencode-claude-max-proxy) for you: **start OpenCode once** and the proxy comes up with it; **quit OpenCode** and the proxy stops. No separate proxy CLI or Docker container to manage.

**Compared to running the proxy yourself:**

- **One process to think about** — OpenCode owns the proxy lifecycle (start/stop) instead of you juggling two things.
- **Several OpenCode windows at once** — each instance gets its own proxy on an OS-assigned port, so ports do not collide and you avoid session issues from sharing one proxy across instances.
- **Explicit session headers** — the plugin adds session tracking on outgoing API calls, so the proxy does not have to infer sessions from fingerprints alone.

## How It Works

```

## Quick Start

The plugin hooks into OpenCode's plugin system. When OpenCode launches, it starts the proxy, configures the Anthropic provider, and cleans everything up on exit.

**1. Authenticate with Claude (one-time)**

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude login
```

**2. Add to your `opencode.json`**

Global (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) or project-level:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-with-claude"],
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:3456",
        "apiKey": "dummy"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The `apiKey` is a placeholder — authentication goes through your Claude Max session via `claude login`, not an API key. The `baseURL` is the default proxy port. If port 3456 is already in use (e.g., another OpenCode instance), the plugin automatically starts the proxy on a different port and overrides the `baseURL` at runtime.

**3. Run OpenCode**

```bash
opencode
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude Code CLI not found"

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### "Claude not authenticated"

```bash
claude login
```

This opens a browser for OAuth. Your Claude Max subscription credentials are needed.

### "Proxy failed to start"

1. Check Claude auth: `claude auth status`
2. Ensure your internet connection is working
3. If using a manual port override, check if it's in use: `lsof -i :$CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT`

## FAQ

**Do I need an Anthropic API key?**

No. Claude Max is not authenticated with API keys here. Run `claude login` once; the proxy uses that session (Agent SDK via OAuth). OpenCode still expects an `apiKey` field, so the plugin supplies a placeholder — it is not used for real auth.

**What if my Claude Max subscription lapses?**

The proxy will fail to authenticate. Run `claude auth status`. You need an active Claude Max plan; see [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) for current options and pricing.

**Can I run several OpenCode instances at once?**

Yes. The first instance uses port **3456** by default; others get a free OS-assigned port, so nothing extra to configure.

**Is this the same as using the Anthropic API directly?**

Not exactly. OpenCode speaks Anthropic-style HTTP to the local proxy; the proxy maps requests to the Claude Agent SDK and your Claude Max session. Usage limits follow your Max subscription, not Anthropic API billing tiers.
